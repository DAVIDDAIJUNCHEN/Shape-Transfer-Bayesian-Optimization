# Real example: Tornoto-Housing-Market
## Example introduction
The Tornoto-Housing-Market example is from a opensource github repo, which uses PostgreSQL database and pandas to 
create features for predicting house price in Tornoto. In our STBO project, we just reuse their processed training data to build a XGBoost model.
